# System Architecture & Design Principles

## Overview

This NestJS monolith template is designed to provide a solid foundation for
building scalable, maintainable applications. It follows well-established design
principles and patterns to ensure code quality, testability, and extensibility.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of
concerns:

```
src/
├── config/                  # Application configuration
│   ├── environment.ts       # Environment variables configuration
│   └── validation.ts        # Configuration validation schema
├── modules/                 # Feature modules
│   ├── auth/                # Authentication module

```

## Design Principles

### Modularity

The application is organized into cohesive modules, each encapsulating a
specific domain of functionality. This promotes:

- **High cohesion**: Related code is grouped together
- **Low coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Independent testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different parts of the
  application

### Dependency Injection

NestJS's dependency injection system is leveraged to:

- Decouple components and improve testability
- Manage component lifecycles
- Provide a consistent approach to dependency management

### SOLID Principles

The codebase follows SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a single reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one
  general interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Repository Pattern

Database access is abstracted through Prisma's client, providing:

- Separation between domain logic and data access
- Clean testing through repository mocking
- Centralized data access logic
- Type-safe database operations

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs are used to:

- Define the shape of data passed between layers
- Validate incoming data with class-validator
- Document API request/response structures

## Operational Scripts

The application includes a comprehensive set of bash scripts to streamline
development, deployment, and operational tasks. These scripts enable developers
to:

- Initialize a new development environment from scratch
- Manage Docker containers for the application and its dependencies
- Handle database migrations and schema changes using Prisma
- Perform backups and restores of the database
- Monitor application health and performance
- Automate common tasks for local development and CI/CD pipelines

All operational scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory and are designed
to be composable, well-documented, and idempotent. See
[05_OPERATIONAL_SCRIPTS.md](./05_OPERATIONAL_SCRIPTS.md) for detailed
documentation on each script.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: NestJS with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport
- **Validation**: class-validator
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Extension Points

The architecture provides several extension points:

1. **New Modules**: Add new domain features by creating new modules
2. **Middleware**: Add global or route-specific middleware
3. **Guards**: Implement custom authorization logic
4. **Interceptors**: Transform responses or implement cross-cutting concerns
5. **Exception Filters**: Handle specific error types
6. **Custom Decorators**: Create custom parameter or method decorators
7. **New Scripts**: Add new operational scripts for specific tasks

## Upcoming Features

Future enhancements planned for this template:

1. **Event System**: For decoupled communication between modules
2. **CQRS Integration**: For complex domains requiring command/query separation
3. **Microservices Support**: Facilitate transitioning to microservices when
   needed
4. **GraphQL Support**: Alternative API approach alongside REST
